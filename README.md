# BIONDA
Because of the steadily increasing and already manually unmanageable total number of bi-omarker-related articles in biomedical research, there is a need for intelligent systems that extract all relevant information from biomedical texts and provide it as structured information to research-ers in a user-friendly way. To address this, BIONDA was implemented as a free text mining-based online database for molecular biomarkers including genes, proteins and miRNAs and for all kinds of diseases. The contained structured information on published biomarkers is extracted automati-cally from Europe PMC publication abstracts and high-quality sources like UniProt and Disease Ontology. This allows frequent content updates.
